# LeNet-5 MNIST Reproduction

Faithful implementation of the original **LeNet-5** CNN from LeCun et al. (1998), trained on MNIST. Built entirely from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project demonstrates:
- Full reproduction of the **original LeNet-5 paper architecture**
- Use of **tanh activation**, **average pooling**, and **SGD with momentum**
- Robust **image preprocessing** to handle real-world digit images
- Accurate inference with **>99% test accuracy**

## ðŸ§  Key Skills Demonstrated

- Deep understanding of convolutional architectures
- Reproduction of academic DL research
- Use of image normalization, center-cropping, padding
- TensorFlow model saving and loading
- Testing on out-of-sample handwritten digit images
