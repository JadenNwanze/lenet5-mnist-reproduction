# LeNet-5: Convolutional Neural Network for Handwritten Digit Recognition

##  Project Summary

This project is a complete implementation a deep learning architecture higlighted in the research paper on **LeNet-5**, originally proposed by **Yann LeCun et al.** in his paper:

> *Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition* (LeCun et al., 1998)

The model was applied to the **MNIST dataset** for handwritten digit classification. This project replicates the original architecture for educational reasons of study.

##  Research Motivation

The LeNet-5 architecture is historically significant, and it laid the foundation for modern CNNs and application of deep learning in computer vision. I chose to implement this architecture from scratch to:

- Understand the role of convolution, subsampling, and dense layers in feature extraction  
- Reinforce my theoretical and practical understanding of CNNs

##  Tools & Libraries utilized:

- Python 3  
- NumPy & Matplotlib
- TensorFlow  
-pandas

##  Architecture Overview

| Layer Type      | Parameters           | Output Size |
|----------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Input          | 32Ã—32 grayscale      | 32Ã—32       |
| Conv1          | 6Ã—5Ã—5 kernel, stride 1| 28Ã—28Ã—6     |
| Subsampling1   | AvgPool, 2Ã—2         | 14Ã—14Ã—6     |
| Conv2          | 16Ã—5Ã—5 kernel        | 10Ã—10Ã—16    |
| Subsampling2   | AvgPool, 2Ã—2         | 5Ã—5Ã—16      |
| Fully Connected| -                    | 120         |
| FC Layer       | -                    | 84          |
| Output         | Softmax              | 10 classes  |

This is a concise tabulated summary of the architectural framework highligted in the research paper for replication of stated results.
